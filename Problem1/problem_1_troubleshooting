Steps taken for intermittent browser connectivity issue:

1) Logged into amazon ec2 instance with the certificate pem key provided

2) i had to orient myself to understand what was configured in terms of connectivity, ips, subnets, dns resolv files
etc.

3) I used ifconfig -a to check the interfaces and verified that the subnets, broadcast, ip address were all proper

4) from there I also checked the resolv.conf file to understand the name servers config as wrong ip addressing,
subnetting, gateway address, and dns resolvers are the usual culprits when it comes to connectivity issues especially
with browsers when we need name resolution

5) I then proceeded to check the logs in /var/log directory and noticed DHCP renewal is happening every 1800 seconds or
30 minutes

6) I also checked the cd /var/lib/dhclient directory for the dhcp leases, but I'm use to the dhclient leases being
kept in a different directory so i had to verify which directory it was on the ec2 instance

7) from there i checked all the leases assigned to eth 0 in (cat dhclient--eth0.lease)
and noticed they were renewing every 30 minutes or so

8) so based on those two files and assuming this is the server for the webpage the clients are browsing the renewal
of the lease every 30 minutes, involvoing the DORA process of DHCP which is discovery, offer, request, accept the IP
address of the webserver was changing or could change which would start the prcess of binding all over again that could
cause disruption and hence the timeoout on the webpages every 30 minutes for a few seconds till the server got it's IP
again through the DHCP server

9) general practice is to keep the IPs static in this case and exclude it from the DHCP pool
