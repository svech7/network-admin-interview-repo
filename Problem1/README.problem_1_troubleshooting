Steps taken for intermittent browser connectivity issue:

1) Logged into amazon ec2 instance with the certificate pem key provided

2) I had to orient myself to understand what was configured in terms of connectivity, ips, subnets, dns resolv files
etc.

3) I used ifconfig -a to check the interfaces and verified that the subnets, broadcast, ip address were all proper

4) From there I also checked the resolv.conf file to understand the name servers config; as wrong ip addressing,
subnetting, gateway address, and dns resolvers are the usual culprits when it comes to connectivity issues, especially
with browsers when we need name resolution

5) I then proceeded to check the logs in /var/log directory and noticed DHCP renewal is happening every 1800 seconds or
30 minutes

6) I also checked the /var/lib/dhclient directory for the dhcp leases, ( I'm use to the dhclient leases being
kept in a different directory) so i had to verify which directory it was on the ec2 instance

7) From there I checked all the leases assigned to eth 0 in (cat dhclient--eth0.lease)
and noticed they were renewing every 30 minutes or so

8) So based on those two files and assuming this is the server that the clients are browsing the renewal of the lease
every 30 minutes, involving the DHCP DORA process which is discovery, offer, request, accept  the IP address of the
webserver was changing or in this case being renewed which would start the process of binding all over again which
would cause disruption and hence the time out on the webpages every 30 minutes for a few seconds  till the server got
it's IP again through the DHCP server

9) General practice is to keep the IPs static in this case and exclude it from the DHCP pool
