Steps taken for problem 3 Zyxel firewall config

1) I do not have experience in Zyxel firewalls but after looking at the configuration, it was very similar to Cisco
routers configuration

2) I leveraged the standard configuration and some preliminary searches to make sure I get the syntax right for the
DHCP lease time

3) Once I configure VLAN 5 DHCP pool and the interface vlan settings, I added the VLAN 5 to the DMZ considering that is
the standard internet access
